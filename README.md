# Sora - Nft gated platform for your community

Sora acts as a private space, where the members holding a token/NFT will have access to exclusive content. Unlike traditional platforms, creators will have control over their community. Similarly, token holders will have control over their tokens. Each space/community will have its marketplace, and members can easily trade the tokens. Also, Sora offers in-community drops and allows the token transfer. For communication, each space has its chat room. By doing so, creators/communities can easily create a token gated space for their token-holders and provide exclusive content.
